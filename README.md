# psych-exploration

This is the website I made for an AP Psychology project in high school (2022). My goal for this project was to create visual examples of computers exhibiting intelligent behavior and present it to a non-technical audience at an understandable level.

To run the website locally, run `index.js` after setting up the node package. The website has also been compiled into a static site which is in the `dist` folder and can be viewed [here](https://bradybhalla.github.io/psych-exploration).
