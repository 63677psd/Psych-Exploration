# psych-exploration

This is the website I made for an AP Psychology project in high school (2022).

My goal for this project was to create visual examples of computers exhibiting intelligent behavior and present it to a non-technical audience at an understandable level.

See the website [here](https://bradybhalla.github.io/psych-exploration).
