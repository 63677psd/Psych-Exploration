block summary
	p Images often contain many objects, but the CNNs described in the previous section can only classify whole images as a single object.  More advanced models have been developed in recent years that can find many objects within a single image.  These models involve many layers of convolutions and predictions that not only find objects within an image but also bounding boxes, or location within the image, of the objects.
	p The simulation shows a pre-trained model taken from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/models" class="link-secondary">here</a> which runs a Single Shot MultiBox Detection algorithm.  This means that an image can be passed into the neural network and multiple predictions can be made in one evaluation of the image.  Models that are single shot are especially practical because they can be used to make predictions in real time, with applications in areas such as self-driving cars.
