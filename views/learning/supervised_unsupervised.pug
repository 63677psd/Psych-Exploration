block summary
	p.
		human learn from experience. machines can simulate this. one way this can be done is by finding patterns in data to come to a conclusion.  sometimes the data has known "labels" and sometimes it doesnt. This is the difference between supervised and unsupervised. Classification vs. regression. Describe simulation, unsupervised algorithm called k-means clustering that is used to detect clusters in a set of data.  Give and example, with a picture maybe? maybe link to neural network section for more advanced learning algorithms. k-means clustering also works in higher dimensions but the easiest way to visualize it is in two dimensions.
