block summary
	p.
		ALGORITHMS. Talk about how algorithms are a super important part of cs, the first way people figured out to make computers smart is to do smart things first. computers are really good at doing things step by step really quickly. by coming up with algorithms, computer scientists can hardcode problem solving into computers.  talk about connections to algorithms in our brain and how we solve problems using algorithms too. Describe simulation.
